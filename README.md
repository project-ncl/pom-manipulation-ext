# POM Manipulation Extension for Apache Maven

A Maven extension which provides a series of POM pre-processors. The extension should
be installed in `$M2_HOME/lib/ext`. When it is activated it will write a log file `target/manipulations.log`.

This extension combines many of the functionality of [VMan](https://github.com/jdcasey/pom-version-manipulator), [Maven Versioning Extension](https://github.com/jdcasey/maven-versioning-extension) and [Maven Dependency Management Extension](https://github.com/jboss/maven-dependency-management-extension).

## Global disable flag

To disable the entire extension, you can set:

    mvn install -Dmanipulation.disable=true


## Version manipulation

The following version-related configuration is available:

### Automatic version increment

The extension can be used to append a version suffix/qualifier
to the current project, and then apply an incremented index to the version
to provide a unique release version.  For example, if the current
project version is 1.0.0.GA, the extension can automatically set the version
to 1.0.0.GA-rebuild-1, 1.0.0.GA-rebuild-2, etc.

The extension is configured using the property **version.incremental.suffix**.

    mvn install -Dversion.incremental.suffix=rebuild

The Maven repository metadata will be checked to locate the latest released version of the project artifacts, and the next version is selected by the extension.

### Manual version suffix

The version suffix to be appended to the current project can be manually selected using the property **version.suffix**

    mvn install -Dversion.suffix=release-1

If the current version of the project is "1.2.0.GA", the new version set during the build will be "1.2.0.GA-release-1".

### Snapshot Detection

The extension can detect snapshot versions and either preserve the snapshot or replace it with a real version. This is controlled by the property **version.suffix.snapshot**. The default is false (i.e. remove SNAPSHOT and replace by the suffix).

    mvn install -Dversion.suffix.snapshot=true

This means that the SNAPSHOT suffix will be kept.

## Repository And Reporting Removal

If the property **repo-reporting-removal** is set to true then reporting and repository sections will be removed from the POM files.
