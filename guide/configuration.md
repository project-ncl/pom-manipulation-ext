title: "Configuration Files"

### Overview

Normally all configuration is passed in via command line properties e.g.

    -Dconfiguration-key=value

However, PME also offers the ability to read a local configuration file. This file may be in either YAML, JSON or Java Properties format.

* Only one configuration file must exist.
* The file must be named either `pme.yaml`, `pnc.yaml`, `pnc.json` or `pme.properties`.
* The file must be placed at the execution root (i.e. the root directory of the SCM checkout).

**Note**: The command line will _override_ any configuration properties _unless_ the property `allowConfigFilePrecedence` is passed in and set to true.

### Yaml

The format is as follows

    pme:
        key : value
        key2 : value2
    other-configuration:
        ....


Any other configuration sections are ignored by PME.

### JSON

The format is as follows

    {
        "pme": {
            "key" : "value",
            "key2" : "value2"
            },
        "other-configuration": {
            ....
        }
    }


Any other configuration sections are ignored by PME.

### Properties

The file should be in a standard [java properties file format](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/properties.html). Note that certain characters may need to be escaped (See [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html#load-java.io.Reader-)).
